Current: Create custom component

Use State as Input for Player
Skip Forward / Backward
Auth Token Middleware


App logic: 

Playing first track: Click on search results --> (Start/Resume a User's Playback) --> If playing then add to queue
Manipulate Queue after that
Storing isPlaying in the store allows one to show/hide play pcture, artist etc




Big tasks:

Create custom component
Create Host / Guest class (Get user profile from API) 
Implement Web Sockets


Small:

Update Song search Headers
Move log in to Server

Russel notes:

- Put hardcoded in .env file (Server) constants file fopr any hardcoded value.
getStarted consts to .env in backend or delete
- Tidy Github
- Nest all routes (search endpoint in new file - keep server clean as possible)
- /play exampe. Update other endpoints with updated async syntax. + json
- Consistency in camelcase - prewttier everything
